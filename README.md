# ksp-satellite-attitude-control
This project simulates a real-world satellite attitude control system using Kerbal Space Program (KSP) as a virtual testbed. It integrates real-time telemetry from KSP via the KRPC API and implements a modular PID control system in Python to automatically stabilize a spacecraftâ€™s orientation (pitch, yaw, and roll).
